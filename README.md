3. **SEO Optimization**: Analyzes and improves content for search engine visibility
4. **Monetization**: Implements optimal ad placement strategies for revenue generation

## Utility Scripts

The `helpers` directory contains utility scripts to assist with setup and configuration:

- `convert_service_account_to_env.py` - Converts service account JSON to environment variable format

7. **Social Sharing**: Logging of social sharing activity (actual sharing disabled)
8. **Automation**: Schedules multiple posts per day with configurable frequency

## System Architecture

The system is built with a modular service-based architecture:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI application providing endpoints for all functionality
- **Service Layer**: Specialized services for each major function
- **Automation**: Scheduled processes for autonomous operation

### Core Services

- Required API keys:
  - Google Gemini API
  - Blogger API
  - Unsplash API
  - News API
  - News API (for trending topics)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monetize-blogs.git
   cd monetize-blogs
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv venv

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure API keys in `.env` file (see the existing file for format)

### Running the System

#### Start the API Server

```
python app.py
```

This starts the FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000 by default.

#### Run the Automation Service Directly

To start the automated blog posting:

```
python auto_blog.py
```

## Quick Start

The following scripts provide quick access to key functionality:

- `generate_sample_blog.py` - Creates and publishes a single blog post
- `auto_blog.py` - Runs the automated blog publishing system continuously
- `enhance_blog_ads.py` - Updates existing blog posts with improved ad displays
- `app.py` - Starts the FastAPI server for web interface access

For testing specific components:

- See the `tests/` directory for component-specific test scripts

## Affiliate Product Integration

### Setting Up Your Affiliate Products Spreadsheet

The blog monetization system can integrate affiliate products from your Google Spreadsheet. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Create a Google Spreadsheet** with the following columns:

   - Product Name
   - Description
   - Affiliate Link
   - Image URL
   - Category (comma-separated tags)
   - Commission
   - Price

2. **Share the spreadsheet** with your service account email (found in your `.env` file under `GA_CLIENT_EMAIL` or in your service account credentials file).

3. **Set the environment variables** in your `.env` file:

   ```
   AFFILIATE_SPREADSHEET_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID/edit?usp=sharing
   USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=true
   AFFILIATE_SHEET_NAME=Products  # Optional: Name of the sheet tab with your products
   ```

4. **Test the integration** by running:
   ```
   python test_spreadsheet_fetch.py
   python test_affiliate_products.py
   ```

If you don't have a spreadsheet set up, the system will use sample affiliate products for testing purposes.

### Service Account Setup

To use the Google Sheets integration, you need a service account:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API
4. Create a service account with "Editor" permissions
5. Create and download a JSON key for the service account

#### Development Environment

6. Save the JSON key as `service-account.json` in the project root directory
7. Share your Google Sheets with the service account email address

#### Production Environment

6. Convert your service account JSON to an environment variable format:
   ```bash
   python helpers/convert_service_account_to_env.py
   ```
7. Add the output to your `.env` file or set it as an environment variable named `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_INFO`
8. Share your Google Sheets with the service account email address

The application will automatically use the environment variable if available, or fall back to the file-based approach if needed.

For detailed instructions on using environment variables in different deployment scenarios, see:

- [Environment Variables Guide](docs/environment_variables.md)
- [HuggingFace Spaces Deployment Guide](docs/huggingface_spaces.md)
- Helper script: `python helpers/set_env_variables.py --help`
